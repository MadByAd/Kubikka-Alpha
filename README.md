# Kubikka (Alpha)

Kubikka is a project that i am currently making, my hope is that Kubikka will be a multiplayer sandbox game where the data instead stored on local machine it will be stored on a server so anyone can see and share your creations. this version of Kubikka is mainly created to test the performance of voxel engine on the Godot Game Engine and i can definitely say it runs quite well even on lower hardware. This project is open for anyone to modify on
